### OpenSea
---
OpenSea is a marketplace for the decentralized web, including crypto collectibles, gaming items, and other items that are backed by the Ethereum blockchain. On OpenSea, you can buy or sell any of these items through an Ethereum smart contract, meaning that no central authority ever holds custody of your items.
